We will post the most recent version of these Agreements on our Sites and in the Apps, and any changes to these Agreements will become effective when posted. You are responsible for checking these Agreements periodically for changes. If we change or replace any terms of these Agreements in a manner that meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you and designate a reasonable time period before the new terms will take effect.

You are responsible for obtaining, installing, operating, and maintaining all software, hardware, or other equipment (collectively, “Systems”) that may be necessary for you to access and use the Services and any internet and/or wireless services via the providers of your choice (the “Connections”). This responsibility includes, without limitation, utilizing current versions of web-browsers and appropriate encryption, antivirus, anti-spyware, and internet security software.

<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>8. Types of User Submissions</b>
<br><br>
Submissions from You
<br><br>
In connection with your use of the Services, we may receive or collect User Submissions from you. For purposes of these Terms, “User Submissions” means any content, personal information (including without limitation, your name, contact information, feedback on activities of daily living like eating, exercise, sleep, and self-care; tracking of activities of daily living from wearable devices, biometric information, and other personally identifiable information or personal health information), videos, audio clips, written comments, data, text, photographs, software, scripts, graphics, works of authorship, or other information, in each case, where supplied by or collected from a user of the Services, including any feedback or suggestions for improvements, enhancements, or error corrections (“User Submissions”).
<br><br>
*Data Provided by You through Third-Party Data Sources*
<br><br>
We also may receive information about you from third parties who have received your information because you subscribe to or otherwise participate in their services or because you use their digital equipment (“Third-Party Data Sources”).
<br><br>
For example, we may receive data from digital equipment, such as blood glucose monitors,   blood pressure monitors, or activity trackers, that you already possess or that you later acquire on your own and not from us (“Third-Party Health Devices”). If you supply information from Third-Party Health Devices to us by manually entering that information through the Apps or the Sites, that information will be considered information from you and a User Submission. If you enable one or more Third-Party Health Devices to supply information to us automatically, that information will be considered information from you delivered through your Third-Party Data Sources and will also be a User Submission.
<br><br>
In addition to Third-Party Health Devices, Third-Party Data Sources may include other third-party sources of data, such as Apple HealthKit. When you authorize these Third-Party Data Sources to supply information to us, that information will be considered information from you delivered through your Third-Party Data Sources and will also be a User Submission.
<br><br>
<b>9. Terms for Third-Party Providers</b>
<br><br>
The Services may allow you to display, use, include, or make available other content, data, information, applications, services, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Offerings”). For purposes of these Terms, your Third-Party Health Devices and other Third-Party Data Sources will be considered Third-Party Offerings. In addition, for purposes of these Terms, any entities that offer or make available Third-Party Offerings, as well as any agents or intermediaries that those entities may employ, will be considered “Third-Party Providers.”
<br><br>
When you use any Third-Party Offerings or interact with Third-Party Providers, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. To the extent that you may authorize us to link directly to any Third-Party Offerings or any Third-Party Provider, we do so solely for your convenience. To the extent that the Services contain links to third-party sites, when you access those links, you do so at your own risk. Our inclusion of any links to Third-Party Offerings or any other content from Third-Party Providers in the Services does not imply any endorsement or recommendation by us or any association with the Third-Party Providers. None of the Third-Party Offerings or Third-Party Providers are under our control. To the extent a Third-Party Provider supplies you with devices or services that are regulated by applicable law for safety, efficacy, or otherwise, we are not responsible for any failure or those supplies or devices to comply with those regulations.
<br><br>
We are not responsible for the manner in which Third-Party Offerings and Third-Party Providers collect, safekeep, access, or use information that you supply to them or that we supply to them at your request or instruction. You are solely responsible for reading and understanding the terms of use and privacy policies or each Third-Party Offering and Third-Party Provider before using or interacting with them. If you do not understand or do not agree to the terms of use or privacy policies of any Third-Party Offering or Third-Party Provider, you should not use or interact with those offerings or providers.
<br><br>
WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE COLLECTION AND USE BY ANY THIRD-PARTY OFFERINGS OR THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU SUPPLY TO THEM OR THAT WE SUPPLY TO THEM AT YOUR REQUEST OR INSTRUCTION, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY, PERFORMANCE,   TECHNICAL FAILURES, CONTENT, ACCURACY, EFFICACY, APPROPRIATENESS, SAFETY, LEGALITY, OR SECURITY OF THIRD-PARTY OFFERINGS AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THEIR FUNCTIONING OR INTERACTIONS. YOU AGREE TO ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSS, OR OTHER HARM, WHETHER TO YOU OR TO THIRD PARTIES, THAT RESULTS FROM OR IS ALLEGED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM YOUR USE OF THIRD-PARTY OFFERINGS AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS.
<br><br>
<b>10. Rights to and Responsibilities for User Submissions</b>
<br><br>
You retain all ownership or license rights that you possess in your User Submissions, provided, that you grant the licenses to use the User Submissions described below to the Gaja Health Parties and to other users. You represent and warrant to us that you own all rights, title, and interest in and to your User Submissions or are otherwise authorized to grant the licenses described in these Agreements. You also represent that granting these licenses will not violate any law or infringe upon or violate the rights of any person or entity.
<br><br>
You consent and grant to the Gaja Health Parties a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide right and license to use, license, modify, reproduce, adapt, publish, translate, transmit, edit, distribute, perform, display, communicate publicly, create derivative works of, and otherwise use any User Submissions and incorporate any User Submissions in other works in any form, media, or technology, in each case, subject to these Terms and  our  Privacy Policy. You also consent to and permit any other user of the Services to access, display, view, store, and reproduce any User Submissions that you make available to any group within the Services or to the public for his or her personal use without compensation.
<br><br>
If all or a portion of a User Submission constitutes protected health information or personally identifiable information as described in our  Privacy Policy, we will treat it as such. However, under the license you grant pursuant to these Terms, we reserve the right to remove personal identifiers from any and all User Submissions and, once de-identified or otherwise rendered no longer attributable to you without additional information (including in any manner prescribed by law), the remaining information (“De-Identified Data”) will not be subject to any obligation of confidentiality on our part. You understand and agree that we own all right, title, and interest in and to any De-identified Data. You also understand and agree that De-identified Data may be used for any lawful business purpose without any duty of accounting to you. For example, once de-identified, we may use De-Identified Data from User Submissions in our publications, in sales and marketing materials, and for product research and development.
By providing you with the ability to post and use User Submissions, we do not undertake any obligation or liability relating to those User Submissions, the User Submissions of others, or any related activities. We do not endorse any User Submissions. You acknowledge that all User Submissions submitted, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or displayed are the sole responsibility of the person who made those User Submissions and that you are entirely responsible for all of your User Submissions. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY VIOLATIONS OF LAWS AND FOR ANY INFRINGEMENTS OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS CAUSED BY YOUR USER SUBMISSIONS.
<br><br>
We do not control User Submissions from other users. Accordingly, we do not guarantee the authenticity, accuracy, integrity, or quality of any User Submissions. WE DO NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT, OR GUARANTEE THE CURRENCY OR ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY USER, AND WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF USERS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR USE OF THE SERVICES.
<br><br>
You understand and agree that, in accessing or using the Services, you may be exposed to User Submissions that are offensive or objectionable. Although we reserve the right to do so, we have no obligation to monitor the Services or any User Submissions. WE DISCLAIM ANY ACTUAL OR IMPLIED DUTY TO MONITOR USER SUBMISSIONS AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY USER SUBMISSIONS OR FOR THE QUALITY OR ACCURACY OF OTHER INFORMATION USERS PROVIDE THROUGH USING THE SERVICES.
